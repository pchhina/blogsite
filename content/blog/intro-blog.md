## The beginning (h2)
As they say, to begin, begin. So here I am!. For the portfolio website, I wanted to start from the beginning. Over the last few years, I was constantly trying to make a cleaner portfolio but hacking someone else's theme has its downsides. I found that while it is easy to get to 80% of what you want quickly but to get the rest 20% is a challenge. Especially when you say to yourself that oh, it's the only project I am using HTML, CSS and GO so there is no need to learn the fundamentals.

Over the last few months however, I am constantly trying to make my life simple but still functional. I am attracted to designs that are simple and minimal but at the same time don't give up the functionality. 

## Second level heading (h3)
This is a second level heading. Now I am going to try some common markdown formats.

> #### This is h4 level block quote.

## Now to show example of links
Here is the [website](https://thoughtbot.com/blog) that inspired the design of my blog.

## Now to show code in a regular paragraph
A simple python program will look like `print ("Hello World")`.

## Now to show code in a separate block
You will have to indent the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab.

```python
 msg = "Hello World!"
 print(msg)
 def main():
  for i in range(10):
    print(i)

 main()
```

```r
msg <- "Hello World!"
print(msg)
```

```javascript
var products = ["Choo Cho Chocolate", "Icy Mint", "Cake Batter"];
var hasBubblegum = [false, true, false];
var i = 0;
```

Ok, these are different languages. But they do look the same in terms of highlighting. Now let's move onto integrating MathJax.

### Integrating Mathjax

$$
\begin{align}
a = b^2 + c^3 \newline
\sqrt(x+y)=z^{4+exp(n)}
\end{align}
$$
