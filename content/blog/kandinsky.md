Kandinsky was a German artist who practiced many abstract styles during his
carrier. While teaching at the Bauhaus school in Germany during 1920s, he worked on
relationships among lines, curves and circles. Following is an example of his
work called *Circles in a Circle (1923)*. I attempted to [recreate](https://github.com/pchhina/kandinsky-circles) his art using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) javascript
library.
