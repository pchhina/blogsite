I am interested in computing. Specifically, I like to think about machine learning, algorithms and program design. I like to learn new programming languages just for fun. I have worked on personal projects in data science, machine learning, simple games, web and mobile development. For my professional work, I'm building LLM platform for financial data management. Here is my [portfolio](https://pchhina.github.io/) of current and past projects.
