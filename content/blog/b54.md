Besides creating [modular objects](../b52), classes can also be used to group similar functions together. Let's say in a game, we want to calculate new position of a player as it moves forward or backward. We can wrap the two functions in a class and then call it whenever we need:
```javascript
class Position{
    
    // return new position by subtracting delta from old
    newPositionReverse(x, delta = 1){
        return x - delta;
    }

    // return new position by adding delta to old
    newPositionForward(x, delta = 1){
        return x + delta;
    }
}

const pos = new Position();

console.log(pos.newPositionReverse(10));
// 9
console.log(pos.newPositionReverse(10, 5));
// 5
console.log(pos.newPositionForward(10));
// 11
console.log(pos.newPositionForward(10, 5));
// 15
```
Typically, we will not use the functions in the same file where we created these. Instead, our main program may need functions from multiple files (called **modules** in this context). I have updated my older [note](../b26) to show how it is accomplished.
