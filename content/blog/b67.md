The *Luhn algorithm* is used to check bank card numbers for simple errors such as mistyping a digits, and proceeds as follows:

- consider each digit as a separate number;
- moving left, double every other number from the second last;
- subtract 9 from each number that is now greater than 9;
- add all the resulting numbers together;
- if the total is divisible by 10, the card is valid.

Let's see how we can implement for a simple case of four-digit number. We divide the problem into two steps:
1. A function `luhnDouble` that doubles a digit and subtracts 9 if the result is greater than 9, and
2. A function `luhn` that decides if a four-digit number is valid based on the above algorithm.

```haskell
luhnDouble :: Int -> Int
luhnDouble n | n*2 > 9 = n*2 - 9
             | otherwise = n*2

luhn :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Bool
luhn a b c d =
  (luhnDouble a + b + luhnDouble c + d) `mod` 10 == 0
```
Note how the guard equation makes even a single if-then-else conditional more readable.

```haskell
*Main> luhn 2 2 7 9
True
*Main> luhn 7 8 9 3
False
```
It would be nice to extend it to a function that accetps card numbers of any length.
