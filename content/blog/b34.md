HTML tells the browser about the **content structure**. For example, is it a heading or a paragraph just like the structure of a book or newspaper. Or is it a section or an article. Is some content a part of header or footer. We tell the browser about the structure of our webpage using *tags* which is simply text enclosed in angle bracket, like \<header\>. Most tags come in pairs - opening tag and closing tag, with content inside. The opening tag, closing tag and content inside these tags makes up an *element*.

## Where do we start?
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>             tells the browser it's an HTML5 document
<html>                      root of the document
  <head>                    meta data about the page
    <title>...</title>      title meta data, text shown in browser's tab
    ...
  </head>                   head tag is closed
  
  <body>                    stuff that gets displayed on the page
    <h1>...</h1>            main heading (usually one per page)
    <p>...</p>              paragraph, chunk of text
    ...                     more elements
  </body>                   close the body
</html>                     close the html document
  
```

## Which text is important?
Use \<strong\> and \<em\> tags inside paragraph element:
```html
<p><strong>Attention:</strong> Watch out for falling code blocks!</p>
<p>This is <em>really</em> important.</p>
```

## How to link to other pages?
Use \<a\> tag with *href* attribute pointing to the page:

```html
Visit <a href="https://google.com">google</a> to search for stuff.
Here is my <a href="books/book-collection.html">book collection.
```
- external page links must start with **http://** or **https://**
- internal page links use relative path from root directory
