Over the last couple of years, I have developed an interest to learn more about computers and computing. After shorter jibes at very specific topics (data science with R and a little bit of python) I want to do more systematic learning in some areas and learn more fundamentals. At the moment it seems like I might be focusing on data and AI but I don't know. My thinking and interests are sure to evolve as I learn more. It's gonna be some work but I am very excited at the moment.

I believe the best way to learn computer science (or anything for that matter) is to look out for stuff that interests you **strongly** and then see what you want to **build** in those areas. Strong interest is very important to learn deep and building things keeps the motivation.

One thing that engages me deeply is where the solution and/or the product is overly complicated. I am a big fan of simple but robust and functional things. Everyday I come across stuff that is poorly designed, semi-functional and breaks often. In the software world, it seems like it's accepted norm in many applications!

Hopefully I start to see these problems through a differnt lens as I move in my journey and start to contribute in a meaningful way by solving little problems. I will continue to write about my experiences as I go along. Wish me luck!
