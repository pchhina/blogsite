Language wise, I am switching gears a bit and have been learning C since few
weeks. After reading a bit about what C is, I feel it is a powerful language to learn and
explore computer science concepts. Apparently C does not put much restrictions
on what you want to do, which means more power!

## Hello C
As a start, here's how to print a text to screen.

```c
// hello.c -- a program to print a simple text message to screen

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("**************\n");
    printf("Hello C World!\n");
    printf("**************\n");

    return 0;
}
```
```c
**************
Hello C World!
**************
```
