In our program, we want to avoid the so called *magic numbers* - constants appearing in expressions. We do this by introducing constant definitions. Let's say we have a program to convert time in hours, minutes and seconds to total number of seconds. Without using constant definitions, we could write such a program like:

```lisp
(define (time-in-seconds hour minute second)
    (+ (* 3600 hour) 
       (* 60 minute) 
        second))
```

Later when we are reading such a program, it takes some mental energy to decipher what 60 and 3600 stand for. Constant definitions help us design better programs by avoiding two problems:

1. We give names to constants so they are easy to read and comprehend.
2. If that constant is used more than once in a program, we only have to change it in one place - where it is defined. So the design rule to follow is:

- For every constant appearing in the problem statement, introduce one constant definition.

So with this rule, let's rewrite our earlier program:

```lisp
;; constants
(define SECONDS-PER-HOUR 3600)
(define SECONDS-PER-MINUTE 60)

;; functions
(define (time-in-seconds hour minute second)
    (+ (* SECONDS-PER-HOUR hour) 
       (* SECONDS-PER-MINUTE minute) 
        second))
```

Naming constants in all capitals is also another 'visual' cue that these should not change in the program. 

It's worth noting that there may be different ways to enforce a variable to be 'constant' in a given language. For example, in Java, we have to use `final` keyword for such *variables*. 

```java
public class Time {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // constants
        final int SECONDS_PER_HOUR 3600;
        final int SECONDS_PER_MINUTE 60;

        // variables
        int second 30;
        int minute 30;
        int hour 20;

        int timeSeconds = SECONDS_PER_HOUR * hour +
            SECONDS_PER_MINUTE * minute +
            second;

        System.out.print("Total seconds: ");
        System.out.println(timeSeconds);
    }
}
```
