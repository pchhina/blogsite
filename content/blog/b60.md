The concept of recursion at first seems [strange](../b23), but once we get past that strangeness feeling, it starts to show off its elegance. This is especially the case with functional languages like OCaml, where it is a preferred way to solve problems instead of loops. Let's see some examples.

## GCD
There are multiple algorithms out there for finding the greatest common divisor. I wrote about one in an [earlier post](../gcd). But [euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) (over 2 millenia old) is elegant:

```
gcd(a,b) = a if b = 0 otherwise gcd(b, a mod b)
```
```ocaml
let rec gcd a b = if b = 0 then a else gcd b (a mod b)
```
Note that how the actual code naturally follows the algorithm definition.

```ocaml
utop # gcd 18 4;;
- : int = 2
```

## Factorial
A canonical example of recursion.
```
fact(n) = 1 if n = 0 otherwise n * fact(n-1)
```
```ocaml
let rec fact n = if n = 0 then 1 else n * fact (n-1)
```
```ocaml
utop # fact 5;;
- : int = 120
```

## Lists and Recursion
Most problems using lists lend nicely to recursion and pattern matching:

### Sum of elements
```ocaml
let rec sumn l =
  match l with
  [] -> 0
| h::t -> h + sumn t
```
```ocaml
utop # sumn [1;2;3;4;5];;
- : int = 15
```

### Return odd indexed elements of a list
```ocaml
let rec odd_elements l =
  match l with
    [] -> []
  | fst:: [] -> [fst]
  | fst :: snd :: rst -> fst :: odd_elements rst
```
```ocaml
utop # odd_elements ['a'; 'b'; 'c'; 'd'];;
- : char list = [a; c]
```

### Append two lists
```ocaml
let rec appendlist l1 l2 =
  match l1 with
    [] -> l2
  | h::t -> h :: appendlist t l2
```
```ocaml
utop # appendlist [1;2] [3;4;5];;
- : int list = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
```

As we can see that if a problem is (or can be) defined in terms of its own definition but with an input that is smaller than the starting input size, recursion is a neat idiom and functional languages make writing the code in this idiom more natural.
