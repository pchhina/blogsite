In the need to do efficiency comparison of sorting algorithms, I wanted to
organize my files/functions so I can reuse the common code without
copy/paste. For example, `swap()` is used in many algorithms so its reasonable
to keep it in one place and call it in other files as needed.

I found that there are multiple (and somewhat confusing) ways to accomplish this in JavaScript files but easiest method I found is to use the concept of *local modules*. Idea is to:

- create objects containing functions that we need to use in other files. These
objects are then assigned to a special object called `module.exports`.
- in the calling file, you load the module using `require` function.

In the simple example below, I use *common.js* to create a function inside an
object and use `module.exports` to expose it. Then in *main.js*, I call the
*common.js* using `require` and assign it to a variable. Then any function that
was defined inside the object can be used with `.` notation.

Sweet!

```JavaScript
//common.js -- creates an object containing functions to be used elsewhere
var greet = {
    hello: function ()
    {
        return "Hello";
    }
}
module.exports = greet;     // expose the greet object for using elsewhere
```

```JavaScript
// main.js imports functions from common.js
var hi = require('./common.js');    // loads common.js module
console.log(hi.hello());            // use hi as an object to call its functions

```
```
>node main
Hello
```
