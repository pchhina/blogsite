I was a little bit hesitant to throw JavaScript into the mix at this time (while
learning C). Primary concerns were:
- not a good idea to focus on more that one language at a time
- do not want to work outside of command line (troubleshooting in browser?)

Well the problem is that I am also learning about algorithms concurrently and
apparently more work is needed in C as there are no in-built data structures
(besides the bare bones fixed-length array). It will take me some time to learn
to create custom data structures in C. JavaScript however has implementation of dynamic
arrays that I can start using to learn algorithms. The concerns I mentioned
earlier are not that big since:
- High level syntax (loops, conditionals, functions) is close enough to C that
  there is no additional cognitive load
- I can run JavaScript from command line using [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (yay!)

## Here we go
```javascript
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
console.log();

// function call
greet("World");
console.log();

// any variable type defined using var
var foo = 5; 
var bar = "Hello";

// arrays
var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(foo, foo * foo, Math.sqrt(foo));

console.log();
foo++; // var incrementation
console.log(foo, bar, nums);
console.log();

// conditional
if (foo > 5 && bar == "Hello")
    console.log(bar, foo);
console.log("Number  Square");
console.log();

// loop
for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
    console.log(nums[i],"       ", nums[i] * nums[i]);

// functions
function greet(name)
{
    console.log("Hello, "+ name + "!");
    console.log("How are you today?");
}
```

## Output
```javascript
Hello, JavaScript!

Hello, World!
How are you today?

5 25 2.23606797749979

6 Hello [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

Hello 6
Number  Square

1         1
2         4
3         9
4         16
```
