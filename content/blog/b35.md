While [HTML](../b34) provides structure to our document, CSS provides **style**. We write the style rules in a css file and link our html document to that file using `<link>` tag inside `<head>` section:

```html
<head>
  ...
  <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
  ...
</head>
```
In the above example, css styles are in style.css inside of css directory and its *rel*ationship to html is *stylesheet*.

## CSS Selectors
While the styling syntax is simple, we need a way to tell CSS which element of html we want to style. This is done by using CSS selectors. We are just going to focus on two types to begin with:

### Using element name
For `<p>`, use **p**; for `<h1>` use **h1**; its that simple:
```html
p {
  color: red;
}

a {
  background-color: grey;
}

img {
  width: 400px;
}
```

Multiple elements can be styled in one go, for example, center-aligning text for both h1 and paragraph elements will be:
```html
h1,
p {
  text-align: center;  
}
```
### Using classes
If you want to target a specific element or a group of elements, *classes* come to rescue. You give a class name to the element you want to target in html and use 'dot' notation as css selector:
```html
HTML:
...
<p class="intro">...</p>
...

CSS:
.intro {
  color: green;
}
```
