In the need to do efficiency comparison of sorting algorithms, I wanted to
organize my files/functions so I can reuse the common code without
copy/paste. For example, `swap()` is used in many algorithms so its reasonable
to keep it in one place and call it in other files as needed.

I found that there are multiple (and somewhat confusing) ways to accomplish this in JavaScript files but easiest method I found is to use the concept of *local modules*. Idea is to:

- create classes, objects, functions in a separate file. The items that we want to export are wrapped inside an object and assigned to `module.exports`.
- in the calling file, you load the module using `require` function.

In the simple example below, I use *common.js* to create a function inside a
class and use `module.exports` to expose it. Then in *main.js*, I call the
*common.js* using `require` and assign it to a variable. 

Sweet!

**NOTE:** Here common.js may contain other auxillary functions that the class functions may need, but if these are not included in the `module.exports` object, these won't be visible to the file that uses the exported functions from this file.

```JavaScript
//common.js -- creates a class containing functions to be used elsewhere
class Greet{
  hello(){
    return "Hello";
}

module.exports = {Greet};     // expose the Greet class for using elsewhere
```

```JavaScript
// main.js imports functions from common.js
const common = require('./common.js');    // loads common.js module
const greet = new common.Greet();
console.log(greet.hello());            // use greet as an object to call its functions

```
```
>node main
Hello
```
