I had a need in one of my projects to create an dynamic plot. So I started to explore a popular library, [d3](https://d3js.org/), but immediately got overwhelmed. While it is very flexible and powerful, I quickly realized that it has a steep learning curve. I may dig into it at some point in the future but right now I was looking for a simple way to create line plot. My quest led me to [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). It fit my bill - simple but I was pleasently surprised to find that it was also responsive right out of the box.

## So how do I create a plot?
It is indeed simple - you create a new chart using `new Chart()` with two arguments. First argument is the handle on `<canvas>` element in your html file in which the plot will be placed. Second argument is an object with first key as `type` of the plot, second key of `data` which is an object containing datasets (an array of data objects). Let's see the steps in detail:

1. Add the library in html's head:
```html
<head>
    ...
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.9.3/Chart.min.js"></script>
    ...
</head>
```
2. Add a `<canvas>` element inside html's body:

```html
    ...
    <canvas id="myChart"></canvas>
    ...
```
3. Get some data to plot. I found [this](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series/globe/land_ocean/ytd/12/1880-2020/data.json) json data on global surface temperature anomalies. I don't know yet how to bring it using JavaScript so I simply copied it and parsed inside the file.
4. Then we parse the x and y data for our plot into arrays using `Object.keys` and `Object.values` functions.
5. Finally we create the chart using `new Chart` passing the canvas handle and the data object to it.
```javascript
const data = 
JSON.parse('{"description":{"title":"Global Land and Ocean Temperature Anomalies, ...}}');
const years = Object.keys(data.data);
const anomalies = Object.values(data.data);
// create a canvas handle
const ctx = document.getElementById("myChart");
// create the chart
let myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: "line",
    data: {
        // array of labels
        labels: years,
        datasets: [
            {
                // array of data 
                data: anomalies,
                borderColor: "#b52b65",
                fill: false,
                label: "Surface Temperature Anomalies"
            }
        ]
    }
})

```

Neat huh!
