I am interested in computing. Specifically, I like to think about machine learning, algorithms and program design. I like to learn new programming languages just for fun. I have worked on personal projects in data science, machine learning, simple games, web and mobile development. As a professional in mobility industry, recently I am getting some exposure to embedded computing, which has some unique challenges not present in other applications.
