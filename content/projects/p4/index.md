## About
Game of pong built using Tkinter. If the ball hits the gutter instead of paddle, the opponent scores a point. If the player is successful at blocking the ball with paddle, the ball bounces off the paddle towards the opponent at a slightly higher speed. Key pairs (f, d) and (j, k) are used to move both paddles to make contact with the ball.
