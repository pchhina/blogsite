While working on a project, most likely we will come across a problem where a
new package is needed, an old one needs updated or a new one needs downgraded.
Doing so using the base package repository will get us going but eventually will
come to haunt us - either we have already broken some other project or future
changes for a new project will break the current one.

## Solution: Use virtual environments
1. In your project directory, create a virtual environment:

```
>python3 -m venv <envName>
```
2. Activate virtual environment(note that command prompt will indicate that you
   are in the virtual envionment):
```
source <envName>/bin/activate
(envName)>
```
3. Any package updates now will only affect this virtual environment. Start
   working on the project. When you are done, deactivate the virtual
environment:
```
>deactivate
```
4. Whenever you want to work on this project, repeat steps 2 and 3.
