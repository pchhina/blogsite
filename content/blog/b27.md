In a previous [note](../b15), *constructors* were introduced as blueprints for
creating objects. In addition to defining the *state* of objects, constructors
can also define the *behavior* of objects through *methods*. Methods are
functions but defined uniquely for a particular type of objects. This is the
fundamental notion of *object-oriented programming*. 

In the example below, I show this feature by creating a constructor called
*point* (in 2d cartesian coordinates). Point's state is defined by two
attributes - x and y. Following this, two methods are defined for point - it's
distance from the origin through `mag` method and it's distance from another
point through `dist` method:

## Point and it's Methods
```JavaScript
// describing methods for objects
function Point(x, y)            // point in 2d coordinates
{
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;

    this.mag = function()       // distance from origin
    {
        return Math.sqrt(this.x*this.x + this.y*this.y).toFixed(2)
    }

    this.dist = function(other) // distance from another point
    {
        x_sq = Math.pow((this.x - other.x), 2);
        y_sq = Math.pow((this.y - other.y), 2);
        return Math.sqrt(x_sq + y_sq).toFixed(2)
    }
}

```

## Let's test it
```JavaScript
p1 = new Point(2, 3);
console.log(p1.mag());
p2 = new Point(3, 4);
console.log(p1.dist(p2));
```
