**Responsiveness** is a term used in CSS when you try to make the content adapt to various screen sizes (mobile, tablets, desktops etc). There are many ways to design the page *responsively* but it turns out there are some easy strategies to get started.

### Think in terms of *relative* sizes
When the length/size is defined in relative units, the container automatically adapts to the screen size:

- Define width of the container in `%` units. This will control the width as some fraction of the parent element.
- Define paddings and margins in `em` units. This will be relative to the font size defined for that element.
- Specify font size in `rem` unit. `rem` defines size relative to the font size of the root element, which is `<html>` element.
- Set `max-width` on containers so they do not expand too much for wider screens
- **Always** set `width` for the images. Since images are `inline` elements by default, in the example below, we have specified width of image element to be 100%.

To illustrate (and start my new project), I created this simple html for a running newsletter. All main divs (header, image, main and footer) have a **container** class associated with them. Let's look at the page below that uses the following css properties:

### CSS
```html
body {
    margin: 0; /* remove default margins */
}

.container {
    margin: 0 auto; /* center all containers */
    width: 80%; /* responsive width of containers: % is wrt parent's width*/
    max-width: 720px; /* do not go above certain pixels wide */
    padding: 1em; /* relative to font-size of container */
}

img {
    width: 100%; /* to contain the image within its parent instead of original size */
}
```
