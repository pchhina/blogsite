Version control is important. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is powerful and [GitHub](https://github.com/) makes it easy to get
your project out on the web. My workflow is:

1. [Start](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#repository) a project on github. Only Step 1 here, don't get distracted!
2. Go to a local directory where you keep your projects
3. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the github project into your local project directory
4. Think about a chunk of problem that you want to solve to move the project
5. Inside your project directory, create and checkout a branch to work on that chunk
```
git checkout -b fixOrAddSomething
```
6. Stage the files created/changed to solve the problem
```
git add --all
```
7. Commit the files
```
git commit -m "fixed or added something"
```
8. Switch to master
```
git branch master
```
9. Merge changes from branch to master
```
git merge fixOrAddSomething
```
10. Push changes to Github
```
git push origin master
```
11. Take a break
12. Go back to step 4

## Other useful commands
```
git add file(s) # add specific files
git add -u # add all modified files
git log # check log
git branch # list all branches and active branch
git branch -d someBranch # delete a branch
git reset HEAD someFile # unstage a file
```
