I am interested in topics at the intersection of computing and mobility. As the mobility industry moves increasingly towards software defined vehicles, I want to explore topics that connect computer science and engineering. All fundamental areas of computing like operating systems, embedded software, front-end, distributed/cloud, machine learning and AI are increasingly becoming the central part of the vehicle and has to be considered core part of the performance just as energy management, fuel efficiency, comfort, performance and such. While expert knowledge is extremely important in all areas involved, I believe one has to start looking at the entire system more holistically to develop future products.
