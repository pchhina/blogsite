Version control is important. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is powerful and [GitHub](https://github.com/) makes it easy to get
your project out on the web. My workflow is (uses [hub](https://hub.github.com/) to carry out Github work
from command line too):

1. Create a project directory, add .gitignore and README.md
2. Initialize git
```
git init
```
3. Add files
```
git add .
```
4. First commit
```
git commit -m "To begin, begin."
```
5. Create a new Github repository with the same name as current directory
```
hub create
```
6. Push local changes to Github
```
git push -u origin HEAD
```
7. Think of a problem to fix or feature to add. Create and checkout a branch to work on that problem
```
git checkout -b fixOrAddSomething
```
8. Stage the files created/changed to solve the problem
```
git add --all
```
9. Commit the files
```
git commit -m "fixed or added something"
```
10. Switch to master
```
git branch master
```
11. Merge changes from branch to master
```
git merge fixOrAddSomething
```
12. Push changes to Github
```
git push origin master
```
13. Take a break
14. Go back to step 7 and have fun!

## Other useful commands
```
git add file(s)           // add specific files
git add -u                // add all modified files
git log                   // check log
git branch                // list all branches and active branch
git branch -d someBranch  // delete a branch
git reset HEAD someFile   // unstage a file
```
