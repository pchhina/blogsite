A key idea in Object-Oriented programming is **encapsulation** - complexity is managed by exposing only those fields and methods that the client code need and hiding everything else. A second idea is to keep the interface of the class separate from the implementation. Let's see how these to ideas are employed in C++ to achieve encapsulation.

## Two ideas to employ encapsulation
### Separate interface from implentation
Interface refers to the signature of fields and methods - how is a particular data declared or types and number of parameters that a method can take and the return type of the method. The interface in C++ is kept in *.h* file. Implementation refers to the definitions of all the methods that are declared in the .h file. These definitions are kept in a separate *.cpp file. With this design, the user of the class does not need to concern with how a particular method is implemented and can easily inspect the interface to see what methods are available to use.

### Separate public from private
Not everything needs to be exposed to the client code; some fields and methods can be kept private. The private fields and methods are not available for the client code to use but class methods can access this private data. This allows us to design the class with only the required functionality to be exposed to the user while keeping other data private.

Let's see how these ideas are used. We will create a class called Circle that models the geometrical circle.

```c++
#pragma once

class Circle {
    public:
        void setRadius(double radius);
        double getPerimeter();
        double getArea();

    private:

};
```
