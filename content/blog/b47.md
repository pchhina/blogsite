### Create objects from variables

```javascript
const year = 2019;
const type = "truck";
const isNew = true;

const vehicles = {year, type, isNew}
console.log(vehicles);
// { year: 2019, type: 'truck', isNew: true }
```
**Note**: This can also be used for better console logging. By simply using `{varName}` to log a variable, it will be logged in *key: value* which is nice.

### Getting keys and values of objects
Returns an array:

```javascript
console.log(Object.keys(vehicles));
// [ 'year', 'type', 'isNew' ]

console.log(Object.values(vehicles));
// [ 2019, 'truck', true ]
```
### Check for a key
```javascript
"year" in vehicles
// true

vehicles["year"] !== undefined
// true
```
### Deleting a key
```javascript
const fruits = {apples: 12, oranges: 13, kiwi: 5};
delete fruits["apples"];
```
### Merging objects
`{...obj1, ...obj2}` will merge the two objects. If common keys exist in the two objects, second object will overwrite the first values for those keys.

```javascript
const updateVehicles = {...vehicles, ...{isNew: false, color: "red"}}
console.log(updateVehicles);
// { year: 2019, type: 'truck', isNew: false, color: 'red' }
```

### Getting values using key strings
Instead of dot notation, key strings can be used. This can be useful when keys are obtained programatically and are stored in variables.

```javascript
const keys = Object.keys(updateVehicles);
console.log(updateVehicles[keys[3]]);
// red
```

### Destructuring an object
Objects can be destructured using `{key1, key2} = objName` notation. This will result in new variables with values from the object on the right. Default values can be provided (as shown in the example below). The variable would take that value if the corresponding key does not exist in the object.

```javascript
const {color, transmission = "auto"} = updateVehicles;
console.log(color, transmission);
// red auto
```
