Conditional expressions are fundamental programming constructs to choose a sub-expression based on a logical condition. `if e then e1 else e2` is the most common syntax to accomplish this. Here `e` is the logical expression and the entire expression evaluates to `e1` if `e` evaluates to `True` and `e2` if `e` evaluates to `False`. Although semantically simple, it becomes hard to read for nested conditionals. For example, for a function to calculate discount based on the number of items purchased per the table below, we can write our code as follows:

| # of items  | Discount|
|------------ |---------|
|   > 100     | 0.20    |
|   > 50      | 0.10    |
|   > 20      | 0.05    |
| otherwise   | 0       |

```haskell
getDiscount :: Fractional a => Int -> a
getDiscount n =
  if n > 100
  then 0.20
  else if n > 50
       then 0.10
       else if n > 20
            then 0.05
            else 0
```
Haskell provides an alternative syntax called guarded equations to make nested conditionals more concise and readable. Syntax is
```
f x | b1 = e1
    | b2 = e2
    ...
```
Here `bi` is a boolean expression which if evaluates to `True`, the entire function's result will be the result of evaluating `ei`. An optional *catch all* phrase is `otherwise` which is equivalent to `True` and thus is used for conditional in case every expression above it evaluates to `False`. It is used at the end of guarded equation. Let's see how our example above translated to guarded equation.

```haskell
getDiscount2 :: Fractional a => Int -> a
getDiscount2 n | n > 100 = 0.20
               | n > 50 = 0.10
               | n > 20 = 0.05
               | otherwise = 0
```
Much better!
