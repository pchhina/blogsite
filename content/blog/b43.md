[Media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) are an effective way to adapt the content layout based on the device being used to view the content. Syntax is simple:
```html
@media (condition) {
    ...
}
```
 Let's see how a two-column content shows up on a large screen and small screen without any media queries:

## Large screen (950 px)
![large screen](/blog/img/b43/size-950px.png)


## Small screen (600 px)
![small screen before](/blog/img/b43/size-600px-before.png)

Clearly the two-column layout starts to get less readable as we go narrower on the screen width. Now let's add the following code, which will change the `flex-direction` to `column` and the width of each column to 90% if the screen width is less than 675 px:

```html
@media (max-width: 675px) {
    .cols {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
    .col-1,
    .col-2 {
        width: 90%;
    }
}
```

## Small screen (600 px) after adding the media query
![small screen after](/blog/img/b43/size-600px-after.png)

Sweet!
