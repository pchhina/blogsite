It turns out that it is common for APIs to output data in JSON format. JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) format is surprisingly simple - it's basically a *stringified* version of regular JavaScript object, meaning if we have an object `{name: "param", hasPlayed: true}`, it's JSON equivalent is `'{"name": "param","hasPlayed": false}'`. We use `JSON.stringify` to convert object to JSON and `JSON.parse` to get back the object from JSON:

### Converting JavaScript object to JSON
```javascript
let player = {
    name: "param",
    hasPlayed: true
};

let outData = JSON.stringify(player);
```

### Converting JSON to JavaScript object
```javascript
let inData = JSON.parse(outData);
```
