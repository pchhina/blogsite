Scope refers to rules dictating how the variable is searched for in a program when its value is needed. Lexical scope means that if a variable is not found in its *local* environment (within the first set of curly braces or the function that needs the value), it is looked within the *parent* function that *contains* it.

Now, whenever we write a function using `function()` keyword, it creates its own `this` object. This poses a problem in classes where a method uses a callback function (for example, attaching event listeners to html elements) and that callback function needs access to `this` properties of the object:
```javascript
function noArrow(){
    this.show = 10;
    setTimeout(function(){
        console.log(this.show);
    }, 2000);
}

noArrow();
// undefined
```
 Before arrow functions were introduced, this problem was solved with [workarounds](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). But since arrow functions do not create `this` object, any reference to `this` variables will force the arrow function to look up for the variable in the containing function (due lexical scoping rule) instead:

 ```javascript
function arrow(){
    this.show = 10;
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(this.show);
    }, 2000);
}

arrow();
// 10
 ```
So use arrow functions where callbacks need access to `this` properties.
