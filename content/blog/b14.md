Just like C, simple variables are passed by values to functions parameters while
objects (like arrays) are passed by reference. This is illustrated with a
program below that attempts to swap the two input values. Values passed directly
to the function do not get swapped while the values passed as an array get
swapped.

## Swapping Values
```JavaScript
// swap.js - a program to check how variables are passed to functions

function swap(a, b) // simple variables are passed by values
{
    var tmp = a;
    a = b;
    b = tmp;
}

function swap2(a) // objects, like arrays, are passed by reference
{
    var tmp = a[0];
    a[0] = a[1];
    a[1] = tmp;
}

var x = [10, 20];
console.log("first = " + x[0] + " second = " + x[1]);
swap(x[0], x[1]);
console.log("After using swap...")
console.log("first = " + x[0] + " second = " + x[1]);
swap2(x);
console.log("After using swap2...")
console.log("first = " + x[0] + " second = " + x[1]);
```
## Results
```JavaScript
first = 10 second = 20
After using swap...
first = 10 second = 20
After using swap2...
first = 20 second = 10
```
