[Earlier](../b36) we briefly looked at how flexbox can be used to create multiple column layout. Now we want to go a step further and see how white space around items can be controlled to create a nicer looking layout. When div's display is set to `flex`, it lines up its children elements along *main* axis (horizontal). In the example below, both section one and two have a parent div with class "cols", each section has a common class "col" and has an individual class "col-2" and "col-1" respectively. So the following css produces the layout below (padding/margin code for body, h1 and h2 is not shown for clarity):

```html
.cols {
    display: flex;
}

.col-1 {
    background: #86c4ba;
```

We will do the following to manage the whitespace around both sections:

- Set `width` of each element explicitly such that the total width is less than 100%. Below, we set section one's width to be 50% and section two to be 25%.
- Distribute the remaining whitespace (25%) *between* the elements using `justify-content: space-between;`. This will stack first element all the way to the left and the last element all the way to the right while 25% is split evenly between the elements.
- We do'nt want to stretch section two's height to match section one. We do this by `align-items: flex-start`.
- Add some margin and padding to each item. So we get

```html
.cols {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: flex-start;
}

.col {
    padding: 1em;
    margin: 2em;
}

.col-1 {
    width: 25%;
    background: #86c4ba;
}

.col-2 {
    width: 50%;
}
```
